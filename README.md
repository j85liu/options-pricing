# üß† Institutional Option Pricing ‚Äî A Simplified Monte Carlo Framework

This project walks through a simplified but realistic pipeline for pricing options using **Monte Carlo simulation**, inspired by how professionals like [Dr. Amal Moussa](https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/people/leadership/amal-moussa.html)‚ÄîHead of Exotic Derivatives at Goldman Sachs‚Äîapproach pricing at the institutional level.

The goal is **educational**: understand how options are priced in practice, with code that's simple enough to learn from, but includes comments showing how it's done at scale in industry.
